# Australian Trade Data Analysis

**Author**: Shayan Razavi  
**Project Title**: Visual Analytics - Assessment Task 3

## 📖 Overview

This project analyzes Australian trade data from 1988 to 2023 using **Tableau** for visualization and **Excel** for preprocessing. The aim is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that inform public policy and government strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore import/export trade dynamics across main categories and subcategories.
- Identify trends, growth rates, and anomalies to support actionable insights.
- Develop visually compelling and interactive dashboards for effective communication.

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Preprocessed raw trade data in Excel to create statistical and analytical worksheets.  
   - Calculated percentage shares, growth rates, and category ratios to reveal trade patterns.

2. **Visualization Techniques**:  
   - Built interactive dashboards in Tableau with pyramid charts, stacked bar charts, and multi-line graphs.
   - Applied consistent color schemes, annotations, and reference lines for clarity.

3. **Key Metrics**:  
   - **Trends**: Growth in total trade, with resource exports driving recent spikes.
   - **Outliers**: Impact of the Global Financial Crisis (2008) and COVID-19 pandemic (2020).
   - **Category Insights**: Dominance of machinery in imports and resource commodities in exports.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Pyramid Chart**: Comparing total imports and exports to visualize trade balance trends.
- **Multi-Line Chart**: Highlighting category-specific growth rates and fluctuations over time.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Showing the proportional contribution of each category to overall trade.

## 🔑 Insights and Recommendations

### Declining Exports
- **Observation**: Crude rubber exports are declining due to limited production and competition.
- **Recommendation**: Phase out support for low-demand exports and reallocate resources to growth sectors like critical minerals.

### Import Dependency
- **Observation**: Machinery and transport equipment dominate imports, indicating high dependency.
- **Recommendation**: Develop domestic production capabilities to reduce supply chain risks.

### Resource Exports
- **Observation**: Resources like iron ore and coal are experiencing strong global demand.
- **Recommendation**: Expand trade partnerships and reduce tariffs to sustain growth.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **Excel**: Preprocessing and statistical analysis of raw data.

## 🤔 Critique and Reflection

- **Strengths**: Tableau's interactivity facilitates dynamic exploration of data.
- **Challenges**: Limited customization for advanced analytics and formatting in Tableau.
- **Future Improvements**: Enhance dashboard design and leverage advanced extensions.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Explore additional sectors to identify broader trade patterns.
- Integrate external datasets to provide more comprehensive insights.
- Improve interactivity and scalability of visualizations.
